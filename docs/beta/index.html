  		<p>

  	  <b>SpeQ Mathematics 3.4</b> is the newest version available. 
      There is no beta version available at the moment.

  	  <!--
        Currently <b>SpeQ Mathematics 3.4</b> is under construction. New in this version:
        <ul>
          <li>A function  "Run(filename.spq)", which allows you to insert a set of predefined variables or functions into your sheet. <i>(Done)</i></li>
          <li>Define your own units. <i>(Done)</i></li>
          <li>New analysis functions like a Solver() and functions fnMax(), fnMin(), fnSum(). <i>(Halfway)</i></li>
          <li>Additional of a logical function Iterate(). <i>(Done)</i></li>
          <li>Probably: distribution functions and/or finance and accounting functions.</li>
          <li>And other (small) additions and improvements...</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>SpeQ Mathematics 4.0</h2>

  		<p>
      Besides continued development of SpeQ Mathematics 3.4, 
      I have started rewriting the program from scratch. 
      So far SpeQ was developed using a (very nice and fast) Basic programming language. 
      However, I'm reaching the limits of what is possible with a Basic language. 
      The program gets more and more complex and becomes hard to maintain. 
      Also, support for matrices and inline plots is not possible in the current set up.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The new version of SpeQ will be written using Java (not the earlier mentioned C++), 
      and focuses on online and mobile use (anytime, anywhere). 
      Main features will be:
      <ul>
        <li>Small, fast, easy, no-nonsense</li> 
        <li>Support for real and complex values, strings, units, lists, matrices</li>
        <li>All calculations in the sheet will be kept up to date automatically 
            (no need to recalculate the sheet now and then)</li>
        <li>Plots will be drawn inside the sheet (at the answer line)</li>
        <li>Of course all functions that where built in will be available</li> 
        <li>A web application, mobile application, desktop application, ...</li>
        <li>Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac OS)
        <li>Open source</li>
        <li>And much more...</li>
      </ul>
