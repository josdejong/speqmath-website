<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  cpp2js is a tool which allows you to embed native C++ 
  methods inside javascript. The tool is able to compile and execute embedded
  C++ code on the server side.
</p>
<p>
  Defining and calling C++ methods can be done both via synchronous and 
  asynchronous calls to the server.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
There are various reasons why inline c++ code can be useful.
<ul>
  <li>Execute heavy calculations faster by compiling and running algorithms 
  in native C++ on the server side.</li>
  <li>Keep the client application responsive while performing heavy
  calculations, by evaluating code asynchronous on the server side.</li>
  <li>Computational requirements on the client side are low because the heavy
  lifting can be done on the server side.</li>
  <li>Perform calculations in parallel on the server side.</li>
  <li>Total load of a web application can be reduced by caching results on the 
  server side.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Risks</h2>
<p>
Yes, this is very risky: allowing to compile and run <i>any</i> kind of code
on the server via a client side call... (Well, there is <i>some</i> safety: 
the limitations imposed by CGI)
</p>
<p style="color: red;">
The tool cpp2js is just a concept and is not safe to use on the real world
wide web. <b>Use this on your own risk</b>.
</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>CGI enabled webserver.</li>
  <li>The CGI program <code>cpp2js</code> must be copied into the 
  folder /cgi-bin/, and this program must have read and write rights in this 
  folder.</li>
  <li>The Javascript file <code>cpp2js.js</code> must be located somewhere
  on the webserver, and must be included in the HTML page that wants to 
  use inline C++ code.</li>
</ul>  
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
To make it easy to use inline C++ code in your javascript, a method 
<code>cpp2js(code {, callback})</code> is provided in the file cpp2js.js. 
Include this file in your webpage:
<blockquote>
  <code>&lt;script type='text/javascript' src="cpp2js.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
</blockquote>

To create an inline c++ function, the function need to be defined. This can 
be done in two ways: synchroneously or asynchronously (preferred).
</p>

<h3>Synchronous</h3>
<p>
Creating a function in a synchronous way. This is <i>not</i> the preferred usage,
as the browser will be blocked while a call to the server is being made, i.e.
during compilation of the code and during evaluation of a function.
<blockquote>
  <code><pre>var code = "double sum(double a, double b) {return a+b;}";
var sum = cpp2js(code);    // compile the code on the server side
var ans = sum(2.3, 6.2);   // evaluate on the server side, returns 8.5
alert(ans);</pre></code>
  </blockquote>

See <a href="javascript: alert('Sorry, example is not enabled on this site.\n\nPlease download cpp2js and try it on your own (localhost) server');">cpp2js_example_synchroneous.html</a>
for a fully working example.
</p>

<h3>Asynchronous</h3>
<p>
The best approach is to compile and evaluate inline c++ functions in an 
asynchronous way. The browser will stay responsive while compiling and 
evaluating code on the server side.

<blockquote>
  <code><pre>var code = "double sum(double a, double b) {return a+b;}";

function evaluateCallback(ans) {
  alert(ans);
}

function compileCallback(factorial, error) {
  if (factorial != undefined) {
    factorial(2.3, 6.2, evaluateCallback); // evaluate on the server side
  }
  else 
    alert(error);
}
cpp2js(code, compileCallback); // compile the code on the server side</pre></code>
</blockquote>

See <a href="javascript: alert('Sorry, example is not enabled on this site.\n\nPlease download cpp2js and try it on your own (localhost) server');">cpp2js_example_asynchroneous.html</a>
for a fully working example.
</p>


<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>
The GCI program <b>cpp2js</b> can be called with the code of a c++ 
function as argument in the url, for example:
<blockquote>
 <code>/cgi-bin/cpp2js?double sum(double a, double b) {return a+b;}</code> 
</blockquote>
<b>cpp2js</b> parses the function and creates 
a compilable c++ program from it. This code is
compiled and stored as a standalone executable in the same folder as the 
program <b>cpp2js</b> itself. 
The compiled code gets a name cpp2js_xxx.cgi, where xxx is the MD5 hash
of the code. This name is thus uniquely determined from the provided code.
Before compiling code, <b>cpp2js</b> checks if this code is already
compiled before, and if so, does not compile again but directly returns the
result. So, only the first time a request with some specific code is made, 
the processing actually takes some time. 
</p>

<p>
In the case of the above example, <b>cpp2js</b> returns the following
filename for the compiled code:
<blockquote>
 <code>cpp2js_e6c9eb22819190965f64f46ffd2490b6</code> 
</blockquote>     
From now on, this name can be used as url to execute the compiled function. 
The function parameters are passed in the url.
For example:
<blockquote>
  <code>/cgi-bin/cpp2js_e6c9eb22819190965f64f46ffd2490b6?a=2.1&amp;b=4.5</code> 
</blockquote>
Which returns:
<blockquote>
  <code>6.600000</code> 
</blockquote>
 Note that all special characters in parameter values should be encoded 
 (space, &amp;, etc.).
