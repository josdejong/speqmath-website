Add connection:keep-alive?
directory view: add icons, and add file size and date in a table view

if the requests per second of one certain ip is above a limit, put it on the blacklist automatically
create a second program or scripts to start/stop/restart the server, and to monitor status and statistics
enable continuing a download (start halfway a download)
give a nicer message in the log when a download cancelled (currently you see a "Error: Could not write to socket")
