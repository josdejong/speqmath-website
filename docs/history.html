<tr>
  <td>new</td>
  <td>Function Run(filename) added, which evaluates the contents of a speq file. This way you can easily include a file with your own commonly used variables, functions, and units into all of your worksheets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>new</td>
  <td>Function AddUnit(name {, relation}{,prefixtype}). You can now add your own custom units too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>new</td>
  <td>Operator In for units, "x In unit". This operator is the same as function Convert(x, unit). The operator In supports lists, and the function Convert not. Example usage: "5.1 Inch In Meter",  "10 &deg;C In &deg;F", etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>new</td>
  <td>Function fnSolve(f(x) {, x} {, xstart}), to find zero points of a function.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>new</td>
  <td>Binary SI units for calculations with bits and bytes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>new</td>
  <td>Units fully support exponent suffixes now, fore example "mm2" is interpreted as square millimeter, and "m3" as cubic meter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>new</td>
  <td>Added units: Angstrom, mil, sqmil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>changed</td>
  <td>Implicit multiplications with units now have lower precedence than explicit multiplication and division. So for example  "12V/6A" is now calculated as "(12*V)/(6*A) = 2 Ohm" instead of "((12*V)/6)*A = 2 W".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>changed</td>
  <td>Function factorial (x!) is now much faster for decimal values. Thanks to Rafael.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>changed</td>
  <td>Some changes in the arrangement of functions and units in the Functions window.</td>

  <td>changed</td>
  <td>The accuracy optimizer is improved. For example Cos(90 deg) now gives 0 instead of 7.273641325e-16.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>changed</td>
  <td>Adding and subtracting temperatures is now only allowed with the same temperature scale (for example 20 Celsius + 5 Celsius) or in Kelvin (for example 20 Celsius + 5 Kelvin), to prevent conversion issues.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>changed</td>
  <td>SpeQ uses a different degree (&deg;) character now, which is supported by more different fonts and by the web. This character is not backwards compatible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>fixed</td>
  <td>Bug with calculating Atan2 and Arg when Angles was set to Degrees or Gradians.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>fixed</td>

</tr>
<tr>
  <td>fixed</td>
  <td>Some problems with non-Western fonts</td>
